ðŸ”° Phonebook Backend for Fullstack Open course

The Phonebook Backend project is part of the proposal exercises in Part 3 of the course (Exercises 3.10., 3.11.).

This exercise consists of deploying the backend of the agenda to the Internet, in this case I used Render to host the project in the cloud, so I created this repository exclusively for this exercise, since Render needs the project to be in the root of the repository to deploy it correctly.

Below is a list of the App frontend and available endpoints:
