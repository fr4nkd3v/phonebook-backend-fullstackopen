ðŸ”° **Phonebook Backend for Full Stack Open course**

The Phonebook Backend project is part of the proposal exercises in Part 3 of the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) (Exercises 3.10., 3.11.).

This exercise consists of deploying the backend of the agenda to the Internet, in this case I used Render to host the project in the cloud, so I created this repository exclusively for this exercise, since Render needs the project to be in the root of the repository to deploy it correctly.

Below is a list of the App frontend and available endpoints:

- App Frontend url: <https://phonebook-backend-c66y.onrender.com>

  - Data detail: GET <https://phonebook-backend-c66y.onrender.com/info>
